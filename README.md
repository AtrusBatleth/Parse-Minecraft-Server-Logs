This is a Python script I wrote to parse playtime data from Minecraft server logs. It scans all the log files in the folder and modifies the timestamps to include date+timestamp (without modifying the original log files). Optionally, it can write the combined log to an output file if you want to more easily search for other things. The playtime script calculates total playtime for each player and prints out a ranked list. There is an option to export a csv file containing all play sessions (player name, join time, left time, session time, and total seconds of each session). There is another option to calculate and export weekly playtimes to a csv file (which again includes player name, weekly playtime, and total seconds for each week as well as hours). This can be useful if you want to trend weekly playtime statistics for your server. The weekly csv output also prints total server playtime by week.

The exe file was compiled using pyinstaller and should work on any Windows machine.

I'm new to Github so I don't know if I've created this repository/project correctly. If you find this little script useful, great. If not, feel free to leave comments but I may or may not do anything with them. I just wanted others to be able to benefit from this script since I couldn't find any existing code to do what I wanted. Also I'm using this program to learn the basics of coding in Python (my first Python program).
